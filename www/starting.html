  <h2>Jumping straight in</h2>
In this section there are a number of examples outlined, to use these you will need to compile these examples with both neon.jar and zenith.jar on your classpath
  <div class="example">package org.jini.projects.neon.neontests.tutorial.simple;

import org.jini.projects.neon.agents.AbstractAgent;

public class SimpleAgent extends AbstractAgent {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 3256720689011568688L;

    public boolean init() {		
		getAgentLogger().info("Hello World");
		return true;
	}

}<div class="exampleFooter">Listing 1) The simplest agent</div></div>
  <p>For completeness, we've added in a serialVersionUID, and we've used a method defined in the Agent interface to get a reference to the java Logger. This is the smallest example (bar removing the serialVersionUID, and using the default package) that I could think of that would give you some form of feedback to what methods are being called.</p>
  <p>This is a complete agent, but Neon does a number of things here. Normally, you would specify a name/namespace pair in the constructor, AbstractAgent has two fields named, unsurprisingly, <em>name</em> and <em>namespace </em> to allow you to specify your own grouping structure. 
    If you don't specify a name or namespace, Neon will take the name of the Agent, and assuming a naming convention of &lt;name&gt;Agent, removes the <em>'Agent'</em> (and any characters after 'Agent') from the end of the classname, and uses the package of the class for the namespace. So in the example above, the agent would be referred to in the system as <em>org.jini.projects.neon.neontests.tutorial.simple.Simple</em></p>
  <p>In addition, AbstractAgent will ensure that your agent has a specific identity. Upon deploying this agent into the system, Neon will use the name information and identity to generate channels and attach your agent to it's group router. Neon will also ensure that any configuration URLs have been set, although in the example above we don't actually use one. Now we'll flesh out the agent a bit more.</p>
<div class="example">package org.jini.projects.neon.neontests.tutorial.simple;

import org.jini.projects.neon.agents.AbstractAgent;

public class SimpleAgent extends AbstractAgent implements Runnable{

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 3256720689011568688L;

    public SimpleAgent(){
        this.name="Simple2";
        this.namespace="neon";
    }
		
    public boolean init() {		
        getAgentLogger().info("Initialising agent on " + context.getCurrentHost());
        return true;
    }

    public void run() {
        getAgentLogger().info("Agent started");	
    }
}<div class="exampleFooter">Listing 2) Expanding upon the SimpleAgent</div></div>
<p>In this example, we've given the agent a specific namespace declaration of "neon.Simple2", and we've requested Neon to start it on a new Thread
</p>

<p>The majority of the agent interface is used by the framework to query and effect lifecycle changes on your agent, and to properly setup and register your agent in Neon. However, the single most important method, from the agent developers' perspective, in the Agent interface is <em>getAgentContext, </em>because it is through the AgentContext that you get references to other agents.</p>
<h2>Getting an agent</h2>
<p>There are essentially 3 different ways of getting an agent, each providing different ways of interaction with the agent. The first way is synchronous calls, i.e. Agent A calls agent B and blocks until the call returns. The second way is half-async, where you pass a AsyncHandler to the getAsynchronousAgent call and you get called back when your call completes, but your call semantics are the same in the synchronous calls, which can be confusing. The third way is to generate an asynchronous interface, which gives cleaner call semantics. For a fuller discussion of this see the asynchronous agents <a href="async.html">section</a> </p>
<p>So now we'll expand our basic agent and get a reference to an agent and use it.</p>

}
          <div class="exampleFooter">Listing 3) Getting other agents</div></div>
<p>Although a trivial example, this agent finds an instance of an agent called <em>neon.Services</em>, gets a list of all the Agent services that it can access, and then lists them. You are likely to use utility (or <em>local</em>) agents, like ServiceAgent, a lot. The interface for ServiceAgent is shown below </p>
<div class="example">package org.jini.projects.neon.service;

import java.util.List;

import org.jini.projects.neon.agents.SensorAgent;
import org.jini.projects.neon.collaboration.Collaborative;

public interface ServiceAgent extends Collaborative, SensorAgent{
	public abstract List getAgentHosts();
	public abstract List getNamedService(String name, Class serviceClass);
	public abstract List getService(Class serviceClass);
	public abstract Object getSingleService(Class serviceClass);
	public abstract Object getSingleNamedService(String name,Class serviceClass);	
}
  <div class="exampleFooter">Listing 4) The ServiceAgentIntf Interface</div></div>
<p>There are methods here that allow you to get the set of services, although expansion of the interface to allow full entry matching may be better. You will notice that the interface extends two other interfaces, Collaborative, and SensorAgent (which in turn extends Collaborative). Any interface in your agent that extends Collaborative, automatically makes the methods in that interface available for collaboration, in other words allows the methods in the interface to accept calls from other Agents. The sensor agent allows other agents to register for events that the agent will generate. For completeness, we'll add a snippet of the ServiceAgent (which implements ServiceAgentIntf) so you can see how things fit together.</p>
<div class="example">package org.jini.projects.neon.service;
.....
public class ServiceAgent extends AbstractAgent implements ServiceDiscoveryListener, LocalAgent, SensorAgent, ServiceAgentIntf {
	private Logger svcLog;
	private List AgHostList = new ArrayList();
	private LookupDiscoveryManager ldm;
	private ServiceDiscoveryManager sdm;
	private LookupCache cache;
	private Map sensors = new HashMap();
	
	public ServiceAgent() {
		this.name = "Services";
		this.namespace = "neon";
	}
	
	public boolean init() {
		try {
			svcLog = getAgentLogger();
			
			Configuration config = getAgentConfiguration();
			String[] groups = (String[]) config.getEntry("serviceAgent", "sdmLookupGroups", String[].class);
			ldm = new LookupDiscoveryManager(groups, null, null);
			sdm = new ServiceDiscoveryManager(ldm, null);
			cache = sdm.createLookupCache(new ServiceTemplate(null, null, null), null, this);
			try {
				wait(10*com.sun.jini.constants.TimeConstants.SECONDS);
			} catch(Exception ex){
				
			}
			
		} catch (ConfigurationException e) {
			....
			return false;
		}
		return true;
	}

	public List getAgentHosts() {
		AgHostList.clear();
		ServiceItem[] services = cache.lookup(new AgentServiceFilter(), 50);
		for (int i = 0; i < services.length; i++)
			this.AgHostList.add(services[i]);
		return AgHostList;
	}
	
	public void serviceAdded(ServiceDiscoveryEvent event) {
		ServiceItem si = event.getPostEventServiceItem();
		svcLog.finer("Service Added: " + si.serviceID + "{ " + si.service.getClass().getName() + "}");
		
	}
	public boolean addListener(AgentIdentity listener, SensorFilter filter) {
		getAgentLogger().finest("Service Listener registered");
		sensors.put(listener,null);
		return true;
	}
	public void serviceRemoved(ServiceDiscoveryEvent event) {
		try {
			Object ob = event.getPreEventServiceItem().service;
			Collection c = sensors.entrySet();
			svcLog.finest("Service Removed: " + event.getPreEventServiceItem().serviceID);
			svcLog.finest("Service removed is of type: " + ob.getClass().getName());
			if (ob instanceof AgentService) {
				for (Iterator iter = c.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
					Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) iter.next();
					AgentIdentity id = (AgentIdentity) entry.getKey();
					MessageHeader header = new MessageHeader();
					EventMessage msg = new EventMessage(header, 
										event.getPreEventServiceItem().serviceID,
										0, "AgentServiceRemoved");
					try {
						context.sendMessage(id.getID(), msg);
						svcLog.finest("Event message sent");
					} catch (NoSuchAgentException e) {
						// TODO Handle NoSuchAgentException
						e.printStackTrace();
					}
				}
			}
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			ex.printStackTrace();
		}
	}<div class="exampleFooter">Listing 5) The ServiceAgent (snippet)</div></div>
<p>In the listing above, there are only a few methods shown, but there is a lot to be said about them. Firstly, the class declaration, shows that the agent not only extends ServiceAgentIntf (and SensorAgent), but also ServiceDiscoveryListener and LocalAgent. ServiceDiscoveryListener is used by the Jini ServicesDiscoveryManger, and LocalAgent is another marker interface (like Collaborative) that Neon uses to identify a utility or non-persisted agent; they only exists for the lifetime of the host, and will have to be recreated when the host is restarted. The point behind marking an interface as Collaborative, is that when you get an Agent reference from Neon, you cannot cast that reference to an interface that doesn't mark itself as Collaborative. So in this example you cannot get a ServiceAgent and then cast that to ServiceDiscoveryListener and start sending spoof events to the agent. The example also shows how to register for events with an agent and how to send event messages, although these may be hidden behind a helper class in the future</p>
