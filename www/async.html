<center>Asynchronous Agents and method calls</center>
</div>

<p>As discussed in other pages, Neon replaces the conventional
object-reference/call-stack way of calling methods by intercepting the
method, early on in the call-stack and using Messaging to dispatch the
call to an appropriate endpoint, which then uses the message to invoke
the actual method.<br />
By default, Neon will cause the calling thread to block until a reply is
available, effectively creating a request-reply messaging scenario and
causing a synchronous call. However, because it utilises the flexibility
of a messaging infrastructure, Neon can change this.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Use the Messaging API</h3>
<p>The first option open to you is to go down to the messaging
level, and interact with channels directly, calling
createTemporaryChannel to get a reference to a reply channel, building
your message and header, and calling sendMessage to the MessageBus</p>
<p>This is even more complicated as of 0.2, because Channels are not automatically generated for every agent</p> 

<h3>Create an Intercepted Asynchronous Agent</h3>
<p>Intercepted asynchronous agents (asyncs), provide a low
maintenance way to call <i>any</i> agent in an asynchronous fashion. An
intercepted async is created through AgentContext.getAsyncAgent(String,
AsyncHandler). The object returned will still implement all the
interfaces and methods as a synchronous agent, but <b>all return
values will be null</b>. This is where the intercepted comes into play. An
intercepted async allows the method call to complete straight away
returning null, when the method does complete, the AsyncHandler that you
passed into the getAsynchronousAgent call, will be executed.</p>
<h3>Create a Generated Asynchronous Agent</h3>
<p>Generated asyncs are created by running your original synchronous
agent through a utility called AsyncGen</p>
<p>See the AsyncGen Javadoc documentation</p>
<p><br />
AsyncGen analyses all of the Collaborative interfaces of your agent and
creates Asynchronous versions of them. so an Agent <strong>'BobImpl'</strong>
implementing an interface <strong>'Bob'</strong> (which extends <em>Collaborative</em>)
with a method <code>public String getGreeting(String name)</code> will
create an interface <strong>'AsyncBob'</strong> with a method <code>public
void getGreeting(String name, AsyncHandler contextHandler)</code>. Internally,
the proxy will maintain the handler for each asynchronous call,
dispatching to the handler as the reply is returned.</p>
<h2>A Preferred Way</h2>
<p>There isn't one really - it depends upon your situation.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with managing call contexts and building
your own invocation messages, then interacting with Zenith is the most
flexible way of doing asynchronous calls, and becoming familiar with the
Zenith API's allows you to use some of the other messaging constructs,
like recipient lists, and splitters.</p>
<p>Intercepted asyncs are the least invasive in terms of coding
changes and this can be done to use the same 'synchronous' API for any
agent that is deployed to the system. However, there are two major
drawbacks; firstly, all returns from the calls to the 'synchronous' API
will always be null - the actual call result will be handed to your
AsyncHandler when the agent has finished executing and the return type
sent back to the caller, this could make your code harder to understand
as the API that you are calling would seem to suggest return values.
Secondly, you will always use the same handler that you used when you
called AgentContext#getAsynchronousAgent(String, AsyncHandler), and thus
will have to differentiate between any calls you make. If these caveats
are acceptable to you then you can just get the 'asynchronous' version
of any agent very simply</p>
<p>Generated asynchronous versions of your agent collaborative
interfaces, are a good way to do async calls and still have type safety.
In order to use this, you will need to distribute the generated class as
part of your library, but as noted above you won't have to implement it
in your agent. Then when you call getAsyncAgent, Neon will make the
representative proxy implement the asynchronous interface, and dispatch
to the original agent interface, but will dispatch the return
information to your AsyncHandler. Generated Asyncs is the only way to
invoke methods on the same object but with different AsyncHandlers, yet
still have Neon maintain your call contexts for you.</p>
<h1>Task Agents</h1>
<p>From 0.2 onwards, a new way of handling asynchronous requests, was written - TaskProcessors</p>
<p>Task Processors are used in conjunction with Neon's dependency injection framework to allow you to easily create logic that receive tasks and provide feedback on them, or as a by-product another task, these are then handled by a Agent that does all the linking to the Neon internals for you.</p>
