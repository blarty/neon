<P>Neon is a framework for hosting objects. The objects are modeled
as agents, that can be deployed directly into a Neon instance.</P>
<H2>The architecture</H2>
<P>Neon is essentially a grid system, allowing multiple components
spread across the network to knit together to provide your
application. Neon provides <I>partitions</I> which allow separation
of object sets for  deployment or management purposes. Each
instance of Neon can contain multiple partitions, but each one must
have a unique name; all partitions with the same name across all
instances of Neon on the same Jini group, are collectively called a
<I>Domain</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">. Although a partition
is restricted to a single host, the terms </SPAN><I>Domain</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
and </SPAN><I>Partition</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> are
roughly equivalent, and where explanation applies only to one,
indication will be shown where necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In order, to deploy your objects into
Neon, you must model <I>first-tier objects </I>as agents. A
First-tier object, is the core object that is exposed to both Neon
and other agents; as such Neon provides a set of interfaces and
abstract classes to help you build agents. As part of these
interfaces, Neon provides the means to allow your components to
interact with each other and for one component to expose the
functionality it will allow other agents to use; this is termed
<I>Collaboration.</I> Collaboration between components can occur not
only between agents in the same Partition (i.e. the same host) , but
also between agents in various Partitions across the Domain, and even
between agent on different hosts in different Domains. To support
this, Neon uses a messaging system called <I>Zenith</I>; this
provides all the required routing capabilities, and provides numerous
messaging components to manage interactions between endpoints on the
messaging system; in Neon's case these will be agent endpoints, but
you can add other endpoints into Zenith, and call them from your
agents.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Neon also provides support for
transactions and all agents are capable of carrying a transaction,
and with the appropriate interface support an agent can also react to
2PC or be able to access the Jini transaction in order to send on to
another Jini service. Transactions are also automatically propagated
across partitions and domains.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Internal Tomcat integration is also
available within Neon, and should not interfere with any existing
webapps that you have deployed. An instance can be configured to
automatically start Tomcat within the instance VM, and provide access
to the Neon core. This allows you to obtain agents and interact with
them, and provide a web front end to your grid application. Also,
agents can provide a <I>presentable format</I> of their data when
requested, which can then be rendered via a RenderAgent; this could
render your data as XML, HTML, raw text, or if you had the required
software PDF, so building autonomous agents that can generate reports
is very easy.</P>
